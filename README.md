# TeamProjectAndProfessionalism
Repository containing assignment work for the module KV6002 Team Project and Professionalism.

Style guide:

  - Use Unreal Engine version 4.20.3 for compatibility
  - Keep file structure neat and organised
  - Give GitHub commits appropriate and detailed comments
  - Enclose any blueprint work in Unreal Engine with a coloured comment bubble
  - Any work specific to you in Unreal Engine, give the folder your colour. E.g in the "Content Browser", the folder "AI" is coloured blue
