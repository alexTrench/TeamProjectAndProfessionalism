\begin{easylist}
& \textbf{Working Together}
	\bigskip
&&	All group members will be respectful of one another's beliefs and cultural
	backgrounds.
	\bigskip
&&	There will be no discrimination of sex, sexual orientation, nationality,
	colour, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, disability, or and other 
	factor not specified in this document.
	\bigskip
&&	There will be no belittling the ideas and opinions of other group members.
	Every member should be able to feel included in the group.
	\bigskip
&&	All group members will be treated equally and with respect.
	\bigskip
&&	Do not interrupt other group members whilst they are speaking.
	\bigskip
&&	There will be no personal attacks on group members. Instead, provide 
	constructive criticism on ideas if necessary. 
	\bigskip
&&	If any conflicts arise between group members,they  will be dealt with
	by talking it out with the rest of the team until a consensus is reached. If
	the issue persists then the project supervisor will be consulted to help
	resolve the matter.
	\bigskip
&&	There will be no collaboration between group members on subsystems as this
	is considered cheating. Team members should still support each other however,
	especially if other team members are struggling with the workload.
	\bigskip
&&	To maintain a high standard of integrity, good judgement will be used to 
	deal with any ethical issues that arise which are not  detailed in this
	document.
	\bigskip
& \textbf{Meetings \& Communication}
	\bigskip
&& 	Meetings will take place every Thursday from 2pm to 4pm, with potentially
	at least one other meeting each week. It is expected that all members will
	attend these meetings.
	\bigskip
&&	Preferably, the group will meet in the library study rooms. If there are
	no rooms available then the group will meet in the CIS Games Lab (102)
	instead.
	\bigskip
&&	Any group work must be completed during meetings.
	\bigskip
&&	All individual work must be completed outside of group meetings. If any
	group member is struggling then they must communicate this with rest of
	the group.
	\bigskip
&&	Facebook Messenger and email have been implemented for communication outside
	of group meetings, allowing for 24/7 communication between group members.
	This will be used if any issues arise that require a spontaneous meeting.
	\bigskip
&&	If a member of the group is unable to attend a meeting for any particular
	reason, they must ensure other members of the group are aware of this before
	the meeting takes place.
	\bigskip
& \textbf{Documentation \& Code}
	\bigskip
&&	All documentation and code will be submitted to a 
	\href{https://github.com/CarlPendleton/TeamProjectAndProfessionalism}{private repository} on GitHub. Group members are expected to use this repository 
	when working on the project.
	\bigskip
&&	All documentation detailing the actions of specific team members will require
	that team member to sign-off that document via print \& signature. E.g., task
	allocations in project supervisor meetings.
	\bigskip
&&	Any issues/bugs discovered in the code will be reported to GitHub's `issues'
	system. The group member responsible for fixing the issue must be assigned
	to the it.
	\bigskip 
&&	All group members will be expected to follow the agreed upon project 
	style guide.
	\bigskip 
&&	All group members will be expected to complete their assigned subsystem(s) in
	time for any project deadlines. If any group members are falling behind on the 
	project, the project supervisor will be consulted to help resolve the issue.
	\bigskip
& \textbf{Task Allocation}
	\bigskip
&&	As a group, members will work on: game design; testing; sound effects and
	music; environment and level design; as well as all project management.
	\bigskip
&&	Andrew Alford will work on the Gameplay Programming aspects of the project.
	This will be expanded upon in the Terms of Reference document.
	\bigskip
&&	Alex Trench will work on the Weapons \& pick-ups in the project. 
	This will be expanded upon in the Terms of Reference document.
	\bigskip
&&	Carl Pendleton will work on the Characters \& AI in the project. 
	This will be expanded upon in the Terms of Reference document.
	\bigskip
&&	Alexandru-Daniel Pascal will work on the HUD \& UI aspects of the project.
	This will be expanded upon in the Terms of Reference document.
	\bigskip
&&	Haoming Yuan will work on the Skill Tree \& progression aspects of the 
	project. This will be expanded upon in the Terms of Reference document.
